# Jenkins CI_CD Pipeline

## Getting started

The objective of this project is to design a **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipeline for deploying a  [Spring Boot application](https://github.com/eazytraining/PayMyBuddy) on AWS. We will implement the necessary steps to ensure code quality and security while automating the deployment process. Here is the git workflow:
* On the main branch **(main)**, all stages must be executed, except the review deployment.

* On **other branches**, only the following stages must be executed:

    - Automated Tests
    - Code Quality Check
    - Build and Packaging


## Add your files

* [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
* [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/add_files/#add-files-to-a-git-repository) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/eazytraining-group/gitlab-cicd-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

* [Set up project integrations](https://gitlab.com/eazytraining-group/gitlab-cicd-project/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

* [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
* [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
* [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
* [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
* [Set auto-merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/auto_merge/)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

* [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/)
* [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
* [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
* [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
* [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.
